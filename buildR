#### This is a function to install (if not available) and load packages used in a script
#### Function accepts two values.
####        packages: a string vector with the names of the packages
####        load    : TRUE / FALSE 
####        dev     : developer names #Temporarily discontinued
#### The packages mentioned in the string vector will be installed if not available.
#### Setting load=FALSE will not load the package post install.

#### Will install packages from github if package developer names are provided
